# Content Remixer Project

## Goal
A modern web application that takes long-form text (and potentially audio) as input and produces various short-form outputs using AI.

## Features

1. ✅ Paste in text we want to remix
2. ✅ Click a button to apply the remixing
3. ✅ Send request to AI API endpoint
4. ✅ See the remix recommendations in output boxes
5. ✅ Beautiful, responsive UI with modern styling

## Tech Stack

1. **React 18** / **Vite** - Fast development and building
2. **TypeScript** - Type safety and better developer experience
3. **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
4. **Axios** - HTTP client for API calls
5. **OpenAI API** - AI-powered content generation
6. **Vercel** - Deployment platform

## Project Status

The project has been set up with a modern tech stack and is ready for development. The basic UI is implemented with a text input area and output display. The next step is to integrate with the OpenAI API.
